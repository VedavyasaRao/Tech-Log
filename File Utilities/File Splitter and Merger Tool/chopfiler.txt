How to use it?
let's say if we want to break a big file data.mdb of 10MB into eleven(11) 950K files:

open a DOS window and change directory to where the file is stored.

type chopfiler D
for source file give type the filename data.mdb and hit enter
for destination directory type . and hit enter
for file size type 950000 and hit enter
u can see that 11 files cmail0.rvv cmail1.rvv ..... cmail10.rvv 
created in the current directory.


To assemble back,
open a DOS window and change directory to where the turncated (.rvv)files are stored.

type chopfiler A
for detination file name enter the file name say data1.mdb and hit enter
for the source file directory hit . and enter

u can see the data2.mdb created with all the files.
